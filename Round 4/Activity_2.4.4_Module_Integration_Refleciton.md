## Module Description 
### Robot Performance 
The module's performance was generally satisfactory. However, we encountered an issue with the motors initially, as they failed to operate due to pressure from the front section. After loosening the screws, the motors functioned as intended. Additionally, we identified the need to refine the code for smoother driving in various directions. On a positive note, the breadboard integration was seamless, and we plan to enhance the front wheels by incorporating TPU tires.

### Future Iteration
In our upcoming iteration, we plan to integrate a robot crane and scoop, as showcased in the **Current Prototype** file. Looking ahead, to other concepts we envision implementing a centrally powered wheel for improved control. Furthermore, the inclusion of omni wheels is under consideration to further enhance maneuverability. However, for the current scope of the problem the current design will suffice.
