## Work Plan Reflection

The team is on track for most of the deliverables. The vision for our prototype is nearing completion; we have determined the final amount of material we will need and created and printed a complete CAD model for the robot with material to spare. The team has promptly met all key deliverables on time and plans to continue doing so.

The assigned tasks between team members are fair and reflect the required workload. Sometimes, either team member is overwhelmed, and we are always ready to lend a helping hand. The project is still within the specified budget in that we will need any extra filament, plc, material, or devices other than adhesives.
