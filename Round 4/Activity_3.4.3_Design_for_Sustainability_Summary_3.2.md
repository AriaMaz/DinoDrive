# Design For Sustainability

After discussing the various financial and environmental considerations in the fabrication and deployment of the robotic system within our team, we came to the conclusion that some of the approaches for sustainability relate to our current design process within our robots, such as using our code to achieve energy efficiency. 

Some approaches we take relate to our robot design, such as prioritizing more sustainable filaments and rechargeable batteries. We plan to add some conditions so that specific devices on the robot run only when needed so that the standby power consumption is significantly lower than when the robot is running all its sensors and actuators.
