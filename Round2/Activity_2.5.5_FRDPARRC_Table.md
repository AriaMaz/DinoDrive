From Workshop 3.2 Letâ€™s summarize your design so far in a FRDPARRC Table. For Strategy, you
only need to list one functional requirement and design parameter. For Concept, please list 2-3 design
parameters, including the one you chose for building your cardboard prototype.

Need to change contents of table below.
