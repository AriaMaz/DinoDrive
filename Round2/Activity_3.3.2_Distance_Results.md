Use the ultrasonic sensor to measure five different distances of your choice between 0 cm to 100 cm. Use
a ruler to measure the known distance and the readings in the serial monitor for the sensorâ€™s distance
estimates. Please complete Table 3 by filling in the measurements.

Plot the actual distance against the measured distance. Include a line of unity slope for reference. Fit a
linear function to find the slope and then plot it on the same graph. Ensure the figure is clearly labeled
with appropriate titles for each axis and includes a legend

Document distance results (Table 3 and your results figure) in the Round 2 folder. How well does the
ultrasonic sensor perform within your tested distances relative to its stated sensing range of 2 cm to
400 cm? Add 1-3 sentences summarizing your findings.
