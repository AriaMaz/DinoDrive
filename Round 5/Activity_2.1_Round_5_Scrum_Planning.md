# Goals for Round 5
1. Complete Round 5 Documentation
- Activity 2.1 (Aria Maz)
- Activity 2.3.3 (Aria Maz)
- Activity 4.3.1 (Daniel Dubinko)
- Activity 4.3.2 (Aria Maz)
2. Team Health Assessment and Peer Feedback
- Complete and reflect on feedback (Aria Maz and Daniel Dubinko)
3. Peer and Self-Assessment Surveys
- Conduct surveys and reflect on feedback (Aria Maz and Daniel Dubinko)
4. Update design files (Daniel Dubinko)
- Include a place to fit in the fail-safe line following the sensor on the CAD
5. Continuously Keep Track of 3D Printed Volume (Daniel Dubinko)
- Update [PLA](../STL_Files/PLA) and [TPU](../STL_Files/TPU) files in the [STL files](../STL_Files) (Daniel Dubinko).
6. Implement Autonomous mode
- Note: the main .ino script for running the robot should include code for the robot to execute during autonomous mode
- Milestones include demonstrating that the robot can run autonomously (Aria Maz).
  - Only need to demonstrate that we have programmed the robot to operate autonomously. Still, the algorithm does not have to be complete or successfully be able to exit the gameboard doors.
7. Prototype Testing
- Conduct tests on the gameboard and continuously iterate design (Aria Maz and Daniel Dubinko)

# DinoDrive Team Goals
1. Begin testing (Aria Maz and Daniel Dubinko)
- After finalizing the robot, begin practicing and  conduct a competition to see who is better at controlling the robot 
  - This will determine who will control it during the competition.

# Backlog Items
1. Update the CAD 
- Include ultrasonic Sensor Attachment and Line Sensor (Daniel Dubinko)
