# Health and Safety Plan

## General Safety
### Emergency Communication: 
- Consideration: establish a communication plan for emergencies in team meetings
- Mitgation: ensure all team members have an emergency contact, establish a communcation method (e.g. group messaging), and be able to identify two evacuation doors in the lab, as well as evactuation doors in the building. 

### First Aid Kit: 
- Consideration: Have a well-equipped first aid kit readily available.
- Mitigation: Regularly check and restock the first aid kit. Ensure team members know the kit's location and how to use basic first aid supplies.

## Component and Prototype Fabrication: 
### Material Handling 
- Consideration: Provide guidline for the safe handling of materials (e.g., sharp objects, hot surfaces).
- Mitigation: Ensure team members wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves or safety glasses, when handling materials. Provide training on safe material handling practices.

### Machine Safety
- Consideration: Identify potential hazards associated with the use of machinery (e.g., CNC machines, power tools).
- Mitigation: Conduct thorough training sessions on the proper use of machinery. Implement safety interlocks and guards on machines. Ensure all team members wear appropriate PPE when operating machinery. Complete tests regarding the equipment to display proof of competency. 

## Battery Safety Measures:
### Storage of Batteries:
- Consideration: Safely store batteries when not in use.
- Mitigation: Use designated storage containers for batteries, away from heat sources. Regularly inspect and replace damaged storage containers.

### Battery Disposal:
- Consideration: Provide guidelines for proper battery disposal.
- Mitigation: Clearly communicate the proper disposal procedures for batteries, ensuring compliance with local regulations. Establish a designated collection point for used batteries.

## Workshop Safety:
### Fire Safety:
- Consideration: Implement fire safety measures in the workshop.
- Mitigation: Install fire extinguishers. If fire extignuishers are already available, ensure that all team members know their locations and how to use them. Conduct regular fire drills.

### Tool Inspection:
- Consideration: Regularly inspect and maintain workshop tools.
- Mitigation: Establish a schedule for tool inspections and maintenance. Immediately address and repair any faulty tools. Provide training on safe tool usage. Only use tools in specified locations.


## Round 2 Review:
The team has reviewed the plan at the beginning of Round 2 and has decided the health and safety plan is thorough and therefore no new mitigation plans are required to be added or revised.

The team is meeting the plan in areas that apply to stages of the project that are bring worked on such as general safety and plans to meet aspects of the plan that will be worked on when the team reaches the apropriate stage such as machine and workshop safety.
