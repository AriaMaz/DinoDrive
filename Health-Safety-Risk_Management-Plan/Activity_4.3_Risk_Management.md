2. Team Coordination
3. Software and Hardware Integration
4. Damaging or Damaged Parts
5. Safety While Handling Parts and Tools
6. Component Reliability
7. Team Communication

## Response Plan

1. **Design and Iteration Errors**
   - Mitigation: Implement a thorough design review process. Conduct iterative testing and validation before finalizing designs.


## Response Plan

1. **Design and Iteration Errors**
   - *Mitigation:* Implement a thorough design review process. Conduct iterative testing and validation before finalizing designs. Example: Ensure 3D printed parts are measurmented correctly and tolerances are added. Monitor the start of the print to mitigate error.

2. **Team Coordination**
   - *Mitigation:*   Utilize collaboration tools such as Notion, Calender, or Reminders, etc, to facilitate communication. Maintain open communication channels and hold regular team meetings. 

3. **Software and Hardware Integration**
   - *Mitigation:* Plan and execute comprehensive integration testing. Ensure compatibility between software and hardware components. Try to integrate hardware and software early on to eliminate large error in the future. Have smaller fails sooner rather than larger fails later. 

4. **Damaging or Damaged Parts**
   - *Mitigation:* Implement proper handling procedures for components. Conduct regular inspections for any signs of damage. Read data sheets prior to testing components. 

5. **Safety While Handling Parts and Tools**
   - *Mitigation:* Enforce the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Provide training on safe handling practices for both parts and tools.

6. **Component Reliability**
   - *Mitigation:* Conduct thorough reliability testing for components. Establish redundancy or backup plans for critical components. Do prior calculations such as torque load, etc, to understand componenet limits.

7. **Team Communication**
   - *Mitigation:* Establish clear communication channels. Hold regular team meetings and encourage open communication. Speak freely to teammates in a professional or friendly way to avoid any confrontation when discussing a problem. Warn teammates early of any sicknesses or time conflicts.
