# Brainstorming Design Ideas
Ideas were generated by seperating the project into subsections. 

The subsections are the arm/gripper, the body and the driving mechanism (wheels).

## Driving
 ### Idea 1 - Real Wheel Drive with Two Other Front Wheels
**Chosen**: We opted for rear-wheel drive with two freely spinning front wheels due to the constraint of having only two motors. This choice eliminates the need for a complex gear system required for four-wheel drive. Rear-wheel drive ensures good traction and stability, with the motors at the back helping balance the weight distribution. The two front wheels contribute extra stability, making this configuration the ideal choice for the project.

### Idea 2 - Two Wheel Drive with Castor Wheel
**Not Chosen**: A two-wheel drive with a caster wheel may provide agility, but it lacks both stability and control. The unpredictability of caster wheel driving, particularly at higher speeds, makes it unsuitable for our project. Additionally, the 3D printing of the caster wheel poses challenges, as 3D prints lack the smoothness required for the frictionless characteristics essential for effective caster wheel operation.

### Idea 3 - Two Wheel Drive with 3 Wheels on Each Side: 
**Not Chosen**: The driving force comes from the middle wheel on each side, with two freely spinning wheels on the left and right for stability. While this design is inherently stable and maintains relatively balanced weight if the crane isn't too heavy, it requires more 3D printing and uses additional material without significant added benefits in terms of stability and central rotation.

### Idea 4 - Tank Treads: 
**Not Chosen**: Tank treads provide excellent traction over various terrains, but they can be quite complex to design and implement. This is our favourite option and if we had more time and material then it would be an intersting design to iterate and create. We decided to focus our energy into the arm/gripper since it is the more complicated aspect of the project and is the deciding factor. 

## Arm/Gripper
### Idea 1 - Gripper + Scooper + Pusher Combo
**Chosen**: This combination provides a versatile solution. The gripper/scooper for grabbing either the dinosaurs or ken, a scooper for placing the the dinosaurs into the box. And a pusher wall at the back for pushing more then 1 dinosaur at a time. 
### Idea 2 - Gripper
**Not Chosen**: A gripper alone might be suitable for certain tasks but lacks the versatility offered by additional functionalities of the scopper and pusher. Also a pusher/scooper can move more than one dinosaur simultaneously which saves time.

### Idea 3 - Gripper + Scooper
**Not Chosen**: The pusher is easily implemented and can move multiple dinosaurs simultaneously without the unnecessary movement of a gripper or scooper. Its addition to the design incurs minimal time and material loss, while its removal compromises usability.

## The Body
### Idea 1 - Rectangular Prism
**Chosen**: We've chosen the Rectangular Prism for our robot's body due to its practicality, efficient use of space, and easy integration of components. The straightforward shape enhances stability and balance, crucial for optimal performance. Its simplicity streamlines the iteration process, making assembly and maintenance more manageable. Additionally, we'll allocate space in the front of the body for the arm and gripper.

### Idea 2 - Cylindrical Can Shape
**Not Chosen**: While a Cylindrical Can Shape might have visual appeal, the practical benefits of the Rectangular Prism, such as functionality, ease of assembly, increases building area and stability, make it the preferred choice for our group's robot body.
