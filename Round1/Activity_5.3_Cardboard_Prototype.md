# CardBoard Prototype

The prototype primarily focuses on the robot's body as seen in Figure 1. Its purpose is to establish overall measurements for seamless integration into 3D modeling. A specific objective we aim to gauge is the optimal angle for the scooper/arm to rest on the body, enabling it to reach Ken while also elevating to reach the dinosaurs. Another objective we hope to ascertain is the overall size of the body, ensuring adequate space for all components, and determine the placement of the ultrasonic sensor and line following sensor.
