| **Strategy** | Corralling dinosaurs | Plow and dump dinosaurs on the floor and pick up / drop off dinosaurs on rocks into the cage | Speed/time required to collect and dump dinosaurs | Existing robot arms and dumpers | Collection or dumping is too slow | A lightweight and therefore quick robot|
| **Concept** | Increasing score/points| 1.Plow to shovel dinasours on ground <br> 2.Robotic arm/gripper to pick up dinosaurs <br> 3.Dumpable bucket on board to hold and dump collected dinosaurs (Cardboard Prototype)| 1. Maximum dinosaurs able to be plowed due to power restrictions <br> 2. Maximum dinosaurs can be held due to COM and torque restrictions <br> 3. Geometric | 1. Datasheet for servo and motor <br> 2. Physics <br> 3. Physics| 1. All dinosaurs together are too heavy <br> 2. The robot is too light and torque from the weight of dinosaurs tips over the robot due to COM <br> 3. Dinosaurs get stuck/wedged between the edge of the cage and bucket| 1. Take more than 1 trip to plow dinosaurs <br> 2. Optimize COM by moving parts and increase the length/width of the robot base <br> 3. Drop the dinosaurs into the bucket from the top of the ramp so cage walls are not in the way (this also puts us in the right place to pick up Ken right after)<br>|
