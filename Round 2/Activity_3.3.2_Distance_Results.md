The ultrasonic sensor performs well within the teams tested distances of 5-100 cm relative to its stated sensing range of 2 cm to 400 cm. This is quantified by the value of R<sup>2</sup> in Table 1 (the linear regression model fits the data almost perfectly) and portrayed visualy when comparing the distance line to the line of unity in Figure 1.

**Table 1:** Table of distance measurements.
