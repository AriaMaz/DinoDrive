We want to achieve all the required activities to produce a viable robot by the final competition. Discuss with your team, and document your work plan for the entire project. Your plan should include SMART goals and objectives, project tasks, task assignments, key deliberables and milestones (course milestones plus your own milestones), required resources and budget, and timelines.
